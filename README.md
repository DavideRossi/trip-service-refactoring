# Trip service refactoring exercise

This is a version of the well-known [Trip Service Kata from Sandro Mancuso]
(https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata)
with a few updates and fixes for modern C#.

The `solution` branch contains a possible solution to make the
`TripService` class unit-testable.
